# cxxlint

CxxLint is a Web-CAT plugin designed to integrate C++ static code style checking with CxxTest unit testing. The CxxTest suite is included and this plugin is used for Web-CAT only. It uses CxxTest for C++ Unit Testing, and it uses Googleâ€™s cpp linter to perform the style check. The plugin ties all these elements together for use when students submit their homework.

Note: You will need Cxxtest, https://github.com/CxxTest/cxxtest for this to work, the cxxtest folder should be cloned to the cxl folder.

Edit: Revisied on 12/31/19, the program has multiple errors and should not be used until they are fixed.

### 12/31/19: Fixed empty parameter passing.
### 12/31/19: Fixed parts of the mess in execute.pl (still needs work).

Should eventutally rewrite in python.
